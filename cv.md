### About me:
 I am currently a first year graduate student. For a deeper understanding of programming, I entered the direction: software engineering. My goal is to become a good developer who deeply understands the technologies he works with.

  I am recently in web development, 6 months. But I can say that these half a year I have been doing something that arouses great interest in me. Most of all I like writing javaScript scripts. Before web development, I tried myself in ML and DataScience, but a lot of mathematics pushed me away from this direction. During these half a year, I got acquainted with such technologies as: React, Redux, HTML5, JavaScript, Next.js, Typescript. Created an application in React + redux, several landing pages, few javaScript applications.
  
  I am sure that hard work, motivation, learn ability will allow me to achieve any goals that I set. And ambition will not allow me to stand still and be constantly in development.
